# 4P02 Museum Assistance Program Software Proposal 

Objective: 

In recent years, engagement with viewers and customers has become crucial for business success. However, museums have fallen behind in this area. To address this, we propose creating a versatile, interactive map for public use, before, during and after museum visits. Our application would enable museums to create floor plans and divide them into distinct exhibit areas. Users could select from various exhibits within each area and be directed to a page with information about the exhibit, including videos, text, and photos. Additionally, museums could include general navigation information such as restroom locations, exhibit hours, and any maintenance or closures. 

 

Chosen Software Engineering Method: 

The application will be made using Scrum methodology, which is an agile development process. Based on the nature of the software the requirements appear to be relatively straightforward. However, in the event that during development we come up with additional requirements or requirement modifications that we feel would make the program better, we want to ensure our development process is flexible enough to apply these improvements. We also donâ€™t feel as though anything would be lost using this method because we are working with a medium-sized team with no sub teams. 

 

The Team: 

Scrum Master: Matthew Litt | 6186548 

Product Owner: Glory Inegbedion |6465686 

Development Team Members: 

Armstrong Isunuoya | 6370951,  

Cody Jeffers | 6468084, 

Siu Hoi Neilson Yau | 6512347,  

Shwet Vasudevan | 6549422,

Timetable: 

The team will meet every Tuesday at 2:30pm. Due to the application being developed in a school environment where each team member has other priorities and will not be expected to work on the project every single day, we will not be having daily scrum meetings. However, team members will provide important day to day updates via the Discord chat.  

The project outline phase will be from the beginning of the project to January 31st . This will be followed by a series of sprint cycles. Each sprint will be 2 weeks, so the sprint review meetings will take place every other Tuesday at 2:30pm, with the first sprint review meeting being February 14th h and the last one being April 11th. The product closure phase will be from April 11th and to April 17th.
